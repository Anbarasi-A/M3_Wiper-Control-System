# INTRODUCTION
A wiper speed control system regulates the wiper's operating speed in line with frequencies. A control signal is generated by digitally processing the pulse signal. The control signal is received by a wiper driving circuit, which adjusts the operational speed or time accordingly.

# SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
STM32 CUBE IDE

# COMPONENTS
STM32F4O7VG MICROCONTROLLER BOARD

## STM32F407VG
The STM32F407 Kit makes it simple for users to construct audio-based applications by utilising the high-performance STM32F407 microcontrollers' capabilities. It includes an ST-LINK embedded debug tool, a digital microphone, an audio DAC with integrated class D speaker driver, LEDs, pushbuttons, and a USB OTG micro-AB connector. The STM32F4 DISCOVERY kit now includes Ethernet connectivity, an LCD display, and other features. The Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC processor, which works at up to 168 MHz, is at the heart of the STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx families.

# FEATURES OF STM32F407VG MICROCONTROLLER
* The STM32F407VGT6 microcontroller has a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 with FPU core, 1-Mbyte Flash memory, and 192-Kbyte RAM in a LQFP100 package.
* STM32F4 DISCOVERY (old reference) or STM32F407G-DISC1 on-board ST-LINK/V2 or ST-LINK/V2-A (new order code)
* USB ST-LINK with three distinct interfaces and the option to re-enumerate.
* Debug port for virtual com port (with new order code only)
* Massive data storage (with new order code only)
* The board is powered by USB or an external 5 V power source.
* External application power supplies of 7. 3 V and 5 V.

# USES
* Printing and scanning equipment, heat ventilation, air conditioning, and security systems all use this microcontroller.
* This module can be found in a wide range of everyday items.

# WORKING PRINCIPLE
Assume the microcontroller is the automobile. When the button is pressed, the first led (red) turns on, the wiper starts, and the second led (blue) turns on at the appropriate rate. The third led (green) will turn on if the button is pressed again, and the wiper speed will be increased in contrast to the previous one. The fourth press will activate the fourth led (orange) and raise the wiper speed in accordance with the previous one. After the fifth click, the microcontroller (vehicle) is turned off.

# 4 W'S
## WHAT
Windscreen wipers are required for the driver to have a clear view, especially in modern high-speed vehicles.

## WHY
Maintain a clean windscreen that allows for a clear view at all times.

## WHEN
The windshield wipers clear the windshield of rain and snow, and the headlights improve visibility at night.

## WHO
Mark Anderson invented on 1902
